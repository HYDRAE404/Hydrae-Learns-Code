**What is it for?**

This is just a repo where I learn to code. You can cringe or laugh if my code is wrong, you can change it. Do whatever code you want, it's open source.

This repository is only for my coding studies (*self studying specifically*). I would appreciate if someone is willing to educate me in coding without any conditions. :slightly_smiling_face:

**Programming Languages In This Repo:**
1. **Python**
2. **C++**
3. **Java** (*still thinking about it*)

**I think that's all. Again, you can do whatever you want with this repository. See ya!** (*ok you can stop reading me now*)
